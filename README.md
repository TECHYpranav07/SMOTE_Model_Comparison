# SMOTE-Based Model Comparison: XGBoost vs LightGBM

## üìå Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive comparison between two popular ensemble learning algorithms‚Äî**XGBoost** and **LightGBM**‚Äîon a classification task involving **imbalanced datasets**. The central focus is to evaluate the effect of **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** on model performance.

We analyze the behavior of these models when trained on:
- Original imbalanced dataset (non-SMOTE)
- Balanced dataset generated using SMOTE

The analysis includes both **quantitative metrics** and **qualitative observations**, offering practical insights for dealing with class imbalance in real-world problems.

## üéØ Objectives

- Demonstrate how SMOTE improves classification performance on imbalanced datasets.
- Compare model metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
- Understand model behavior and sensitivity to resampling techniques.

---

## üîç Key Concepts

- **Imbalanced Classification**: When one class significantly outnumbers the other.
- **SMOTE**: A resampling technique that synthetically generates new minority class samples.
- **XGBoost & LightGBM**: High-performance, gradient boosting frameworks widely used in competitions and industry.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

Performance is evaluated using the following:
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Cross-validation (where applicable)

---

## üöÄ Future Work

- Add notebooks for **non-SMOTE** baselines
- Compare training time and complexity
- Try **ADASYN**, **Random Oversampling**, or **Ensemble resampling techniques**
- Visualize decision boundaries (2D PCA or t-SNE plots)

---

## üß† Useful For

- Data scientists working with **fraud detection**, **medical diagnosis**, or **rare event prediction**
- Machine learning students learning about data preprocessing and imbalance handling
- Anyone comparing performance of **SMOTE vs non-SMOTE** modeling strategies

## üìå Note

Make sure to install necessary packages such as `imbalanced-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib` to run the notebooks locally.

```bash
pip install imbalanced-learn xgboost lightgbm scikit-learn matplotlib
